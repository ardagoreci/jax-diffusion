# jax-diffusion
This repository is my implementation of the paper Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239) in Jax and Haiku. The authors have 
released an implementation in TensorFlow, but their implementation is written to be more general and thus is complex. In the spirit of "What I cannot create, I do
not understand" I am implementing the diffusion model in Jax and Haiku as simply as I can.
